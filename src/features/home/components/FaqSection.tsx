const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Is WeCinema free to join?",
    a: "Yes. Creating an account, browsing the marketplace, watching free films, and listing your work is completely free. Sellers only pay a platform fee when a sale actually completes.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are payments protected?",
    a: "Every order is protected by Stripe escrow. Funds are authorized when the order is placed and only released to the seller after the buyer confirms delivery — so funds are never released prematurely.",
  },
  {
    q: "What can I sell?",
    a: "Finished films and video content, commercial and broadcast licensing, adaptation rights for remakes and sequels, or custom commissions to a buyer's brief — four marketplace models in one place.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is HypeMode?",
    a: "HypeMode is a premium tier that gives your listings a trending badge, priority placement in discovery, push notifications to buyers, and a reduced platform fee on HypeMode sales.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who is WeCinema for?",
    a: "Independent filmmakers, scriptwriters, actors, studios, and AI creators who want to monetize their work — and the production companies and studios looking to source films, scripts, licensing, or custom video.",
