  {
    q: "How much does it cost to sell on WeCinema?",
    a: "Creating an account and listing your work is completely free. WeCinema charges a platform fee only when you make a sale; the remainder is transferred to your connected Stripe account. There is no upfront or listing cost, so you can test pricing risk-free.",
  },
  {
    q: "How should I price my film or script?",
    a: "There's no single right price. Finished short films typically sell or license for modest flat fees, while feature rights and adaptation deals command more. Many creators offer tiered options — a lower price for a limited or non-exclusive license and a higher price for exclusive or outright sale. Browse comparable listings, be clear about exactly what the buyer receives, and start with a fair price you can adjust.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I sell film or adaptation rights without selling the film itself?",
    a: "Yes. Licensing lets you grant commercial, broadcast, or streaming usage while keeping ownership, and an adaptation-rights listing sells the right to remake or adapt your story. You choose the model that fits — outright sale, license, adaptation rights, or a custom commission.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get paid, and is it safe?",
    a: "Payments run through Stripe escrow. A buyer's funds are authorized at purchase and held until the order is marked delivered, then released to your Stripe account. Because money is only released after delivery is confirmed, both buyer and seller are protected from fraud.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does listing approval take?",

          <p style={para}>
            There&apos;s no single &quot;right&quot; price, but a few principles help you set one with confidence.
            Finished short films typically sell or license for modest flat fees, while feature rights and
            adaptation deals command more. Many creators list <strong>tiered options</strong> — a lower price
            for a limited or non-exclusive license, and a higher price for exclusive or outright sale.
          </p>
          <p style={para}>
            Before you publish, research comparable work in <Link href="/marketplace/browse">Browse
            Listings</Link>, and be transparent about exactly what the buyer receives: exclusive vs
            non-exclusive rights, territory, and duration. Because WeCinema is free to list and charges a
            platform fee only on completed sales, there&apos;s no risk in starting with a fair price and
            adjusting as you learn what buyers respond to.

          <h2 style={h2Style}>How you get paid: escrow, explained</h2>
          <p style={para}>
            Every transaction is protected by <strong>Stripe escrow</strong>. When a buyer purchases or
            accepts an offer, their payment is authorized and held — not sent directly to you, and not left
            with the buyer. Funds are only released to your connected Stripe account once the order is marked
            delivered and confirmed. This protects sellers from non-payment and buyers from non-delivery, so
            both sides can transact with strangers safely. Your earnings, minus the platform fee, land in
            your Stripe account automatically.
