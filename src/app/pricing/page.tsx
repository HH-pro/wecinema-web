/**
 * Canonical subscription page.
 *
 * This checkout used to live at `/explore`, whose title and inbound links all
 * promised a film catalog — so upgrade-intent traffic and browse-intent traffic
 * collided on one URL and neither converted. `/explore` is now the catalog;
 * this is the paid plan page.
 *
 * The prices below must stay in step with `PLANS` in `ExploreContent.tsx` and
 * with the pricing line in `llms.txt`.

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does WeCinema cost?",
    a: "Watching and browsing WeCinema is free. Paid plans are $5/month (Basic) and $10/month (Pro). Selling costs nothing up front — WeCinema takes a 15% fee on a sale only when it completes.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between the Basic and Pro plans?",
    a: "Basic ($5/month) lets you buy and sell films and scripts with basic support and 5GB of storage. Pro ($10/month) is built for studios and high-volume creators, adding more storage and priority support.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a subscription to sell on WeCinema?",
    a: "You need a paid plan to list on the marketplace. There is no listing fee and no up-front cost beyond the subscription — WeCinema earns its 15% only when your work sells.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do sellers get paid?",
    a: "Payments run through Stripe with escrow protection. A buyer's funds are authorised at purchase and released to you once delivery is confirmed, so neither side is exposed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I cancel at any time?",
    a: "Yes. Plans are month to month and you can cancel whenever you like — your listings and uploads stay in your account.",
  },
